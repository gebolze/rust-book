- Printing to something to the console `println!()` is used.
- In rust all variables are immutable by default. To create a mutable variable use `let mut` instead of `let`.
- `String::new()` indicates that `new()` is a _associated function_ of the `String` type. An associated function is implemented on a Type, rather than on a instance.
